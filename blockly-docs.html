<p>There are lots of amazing things you can do with Blockly Code! 
But with all the blocks and more being added it is helpful to know what each one does and how to correctly use it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is some documentation on how to use some of Blockly Codes blocks correctly.
Below is a picture showing you how to correctly read the documentation. 
</p>

<h3>Logic Operations</h3>
<p>Logic Operations help code run in paths. This also helps out when using algorithms and other computer implementations. 
Starting off with one of the most used statements in the whole world! The <code>IF</code> statement will take everything in the 
<code>()</code> and see if it is true, if it is then it will run the code inside the <code>{}</code> or in this case everything inside the block<p>

<p>Above is what the <code>IF</code> block looks like on Blockly Code. 
As you can see there is a connection on the right side where you can connect more Logic Operations to it.
 There is also a gear symbol on the left side of the block. We will look at that in a few seconds.
 When using the block in Blocklyâ€™s Lab you will see on the right side something like this show up:<br>
<code><pre>
if (false) {
}
</pre></code><br>
That is what the block will do with nothing connecting into it.
 Right now the code generator is showing the JavaScript adaption for the block you can change that by using the dropdown menu above the display.</p>

<p><b>Right now we only support the Code Languages listed but we plan on adding in more support for different languages.</b></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>There is a way to add in the <code>ELSE</code> block to the <code>IF</code> statement. 
By clicking on the gear symbol on the <code>IF</code> block it will bring up something like this:</p>
<img src="./img/ifDropDown.png" alt="image"><br>
<p>You can then drag the correct blocks from the left onto the workspace on the right. 
You can connect them to the <code>IF</code> block and it will then show up on the code generator output and on the workspace.
<br><br><b>Please note: When adding in ELSE, and ELSE IF statements use the ELSE block to finish off the code. 
You can NOT put any blocks past the ELSE statement because it has no connections.<b><br><br><b>When you are done adding in stuff 
click the gear again to close the popup!<b></p>
